I was inspired by a picture frame I saw at a local coffee shop to put a picture and a poem together. I originally wanted to a multidirectional parallax scroll but that's a bit above my current level. I tried to do a multidirectional pagination but decided I should first try to "master" a one button click for multiple paginations. I was successful on my third goal and very happy with the result.
